# my sandbox from training because for some unknown reasons I couldn't configure our sandbox to allow required ocapi calls
# if you still want to try our sandbox uncomment the following
host=
clientId=
clientPassword=
apiVersion=v24_5
orginUrl=
# theoretically, only required ocapi setting is the  following in shop API
#          {
#            "resource_id":"/order_search",
#            "methods":["post"],
#            "read_attributes":"(**)",
#            "write_attributes":"(**)"
#          }
# maybe the scope of attributes can be limited (TODO: investigate)
